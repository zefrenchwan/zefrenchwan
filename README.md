# Who are you ? 

* A mid-life french developer. I work as a data engineer
* I code in Node.js (learning), Python and Golang (pro and personal projects), Java (pro), SQL (of course, who does not ?)
* Except data engineering per se, I am interested in networks science, NLP and data collection (including webscraping)

# What do you offer ? 

You will find several projects about my favourites topics. 
* Some technical notes, about interesting topics (to me) 
* Some are ready to use, I am quite confident they might be useful or interesting
* Some are not ready at all and I am working on it


## Training (not data science training, but technical skills improvement)

The idea in here is to share some technical notes, usually including code samples. 
Note that I usually write in French (I share my notes, so it makes sense that I choose French).

## In progress / good idea to dig on 

Quite busy with Calepin to be honest...


# May I use your code ? 

Public code is so far under MIT licence. 
In a nutshell, it means "yes" and "just mention that base code came from here and me". Not a huge price. 
I hope that my code and related work help you somehow.
