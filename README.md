# Who are you ? 

* A french developer, old enough to know about java, young enough to not know about cobol.
* I work as a data engineer: I make data ready to talk using Hadoop and GCP 
* Except data engineering per se, I am interested in networks science, NLP and data collection

# What do you offer ? 

You will find several projects about my favourites topics. 
* Some are ready to use, I am quite confident they might be useful or interesting
* Some are not ready at all and I am working on it

# May I use your code ? 

Public code is so far under MIT licence. 
In a nutshell, it means "yes" and "just mention that base code came from here and me". Not a huge price. 
I hope that my code and related work help you somehow.
