# Who are you ? 

* A french developer, old enough to know about java, young enough to not know about cobol. I work as a data engineer, usually in Java, Golang or Python. I worked a lot for banks and adtech companies.
* My technical interests are networks science, python, NLP and dataviz. I also like golang for its speed, and C for its efficiency and style

# May I use your code ? 

Public code is so far under MIT licence. 
In a nutshell, it means "yes" and "just mention that base code came from here and me". Not a huge price. 
I hope that my code and related work help you somehow.
