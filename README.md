# Who are you ? 

* A french developer, old enough to know about java, young enough to not know about cobol
* I work as a data engineer, usually in Java or Python
* My personal interests are networks science, python, golang sometimes, NLP
* I want to dig on data viz

# What do you plan to offer in your repository ? 

* Big data of course, especially data viz for a better understanding on what is going on
* Code about networks science, an underestimated topic
* tools that may help about automatic information searches in general

  * [Nodz](https://github.com/zefrenchwan/nodz) I like graphs, and I wanted to build a basic lib to experiment some graphs structures and random graphs. For instance, what happens when, given a graph and a node id, graph structure allows to directly point at it ? Easy, right ? This is a central structure graph. For peers graphs, it is not always the case, you usually start with a node (not the one you want) and you try and walkthrough to find the node you want. Big difference. Random graphs and percolation, the other part of the code, is quite fascinating.
