# Who are you ? 

* French developer, working as a data engineer, coding some personal projects to dig some subjects deeper
* I code in Python and Golang (pro and personal projects), Java (pro), SQL (of course, who does not ?)

# What do you offer ? 

You will find several projects about my favourites topics. 
* Some technical notes, about interesting topics (to me) 
* Some are ready to use, I am quite confident they might be useful or interesting
* Some are not ready at all and I am working on it


## Training (not data science training, but technical skills improvement)

The idea in here is to share some technical notes, usually including code samples. 
Note that I usually write in French (I share my notes, so it makes sense that I choose French).

# May I use your code ? 

Of course, this is why it is public and under MIT licence.  
I hope that my code and related work help you somehow.
