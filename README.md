# Who are you ? 

* A french developer, old enough to know about java, young enough to not know about cobol. My main job is to make data ready to talk (with courtesy, Hadoop and GCP)

# May I use your code ? 

Public code is so far under MIT licence. 
In a nutshell, it means "yes" and "just mention that base code came from here and me". Not a huge price. 
I hope that my code and related work help you somehow.
